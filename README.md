## Tesselate Bespoke Jewellery - MERN stack app 

## Purpose 

This web application aims to give our client, a well-established jeweller of over 30 years, a strong online presence in line with the changing trends in the jewellery industry. Addressing the absence of a digital footprint for our client's business, the app is designed to create a comprehensive platform showcasing the timeless craftsmanship and distinctive offerings of our client's custom jewellery.

In a competitive digital market, our client, having relied on word-of-mouth referrals, now wants to expand beyond brick-and-mortar. This move is a strategic decision to embrace modernity while preserving the craftsmanship that defines our client's legacy.

The web app serves as a crucial tool to reach a broader audience, offering a virtual showroom for potential customers to explore custom opal rings, a focus of the initial phase. Users can delve into the details of each opal and get a quote based on their specifications. This will foster a more engaging and interactive experience.

By going digital, our client aims to build their brand online and enhance communication with a diverse range of clientele. This venture reflects our commitment to using technology to boost brand visibility, establish a lasting online presence, and position our client in the contemporary jewellery landscape.

Through a blend of tradition and innovation, this web application represents a significant step in ensuring our client's creations captivate a wider global audience.
